# Let's Read

_Link coming soon_

Let's Read started as a small game that I was building with my girlfriend's son, to introduce him to coding (he's six years old). Although he's a little too young to understand fully what we were doing, he enjoyed adding phrases and helping me test the skill as we worked on it. He also really liked that he was able to practice spelling using Alexa. His sister (four years old), of course, immediately started trying to read too and even shared some ideas to make it better. She had some great input on things Alexa could say to help other kids feel good about their answers. Originally, I didn't plan on including any visual elements as this was just a side project and I wasn't even sure I that I was going to release it to the public; but as I continued to work on this project, I sensed that it could really be used to help teach children how to read.

Thankfully, APL made it pretty painless to create the UI for the skill, and I'm pretty pleased with the results. I would really love to see this getting used in classrooms in the future!

## Features

- Fun sounds and images
- 10 levels of play and nearly 1,000 words
- A scoring system that awards both consistency and challenge
- Multimodal support

## To Fix

- Some words can be confusing for Alexa to interpret (this will be remedied in the first post-launch update assuming nothing more pressing arises)

## ToDo's

- Create better ending screen, especially for a perfect score (Current one is beyond bland)
- Review words and assist Alexa with interpretations (i.e. the word is "wood", user says "wood", but Alexa interprets as \"would"
- Create a global daily High Score list
- Continue to add variety to questions, responses, images, and sounds"
